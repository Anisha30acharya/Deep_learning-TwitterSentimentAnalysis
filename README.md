🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis using RNN
-----------------------------------------
🚀 Project Overview
----------------------
This project performs real-time sentiment analysis on user-entered tweets.

Built using Python with TensorFlow/Keras.

Focused on classifying tweets as Positive or Negative sentiment using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model.

The project allows the user to manually input any tweet text at runtime, and it will predict the sentiment.

🧠 What This Project Actually Does
------------------------------------
The user enters any tweet-like text manually in the console/terminal.

The system processes the text using NLP techniques (cleaning, tokenizing, padding, etc.).

The pre-trained RNN model loads the input text.

The model predicts whether the sentiment is:
✅ Positive 👍
✅ Negative 👎

The output is displayed immediately in the console.
